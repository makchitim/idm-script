### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **Clear title** summarizing the enhancement
- **Detailed description** of the feature
- **Use case** explaining why it's useful
- **Implementation ideas** if you have any

### Code Contributions

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly on multiple Windows versions
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add AmazingFeature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7 or later (testing on Windows 10/11 recommended)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Git for version control
- Text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
- IDM installed for testing

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting, test on:

1. **Clean Installation**: Fresh Windows VM
2. **Multiple Versions**: Windows 10 and 11 if possible
3. **Different Architectures**: x64 at minimum
4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - IDM not installed
   - No internet connection
   - Restricted PowerShell execution policy
   - Non-admin user

## Coding Standards

### Batch Script Style

```batch
:: Use clear, descriptive variable names
set "descriptive_name=value"

:: Comment complex sections
:: This section handles registry backup
call :backup_function

:: Use consistent indentation (spaces, not tabs)
if condition (
    echo Action 1
    echo Action 2
)

:: Group related operations with section markers
::========================================================================================================================================
```

### PowerShell Style

```powershell
# Use meaningful variable names
$registryPath = "HKCU:\Software"

# Add error handling
try {
    # Operation
} catch {
    Write-Host "Error: $_"
}

# Use proper formatting
foreach ($item in $collection) {
    # Process item
}
```

### General Guidelines

1. **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
2. **Comments**: Explain WHY, not WHAT
3. **Error Handling**: Always handle potential failures
4. **User Feedback**: Provide clear status messages
5. **No Hardcoding**: Use variables for paths and values
6. **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Modify README.md if you add features
2. **Update Changelog**: Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all functionality works
4. **Clear Description**: Explain what and why
5. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues if applicable
6. **Small PRs**: Keep changes focused and manageable

### PR Template

```markdown

- [ ] Tested on multiple Windows versions
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
```

## Version Numbering

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New backwards-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

Update version in:
- `ias.cmd` (line 1: `@set iasver=X.Y.Z`)
- `README.md` (Version History section)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (move `[Unreleased]` to a new dated version entry)

Bump the version as part of the release itself, once changes are merged into
`main` and pushed — not while work is still on a feature branch. Check Script
Update [8] compares the local `iasver` against the copy of `ias.cmd` published
on `main`; bumping it earlier makes that comparison meaningless for anyone
still running the previously released version.
